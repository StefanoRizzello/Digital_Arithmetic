# Digital_Arithmetic
 The aim of this lab is to deal with digital arithmetic issues.

The following VHDL implementation can be found inside the src folder: 
- pipeline FPmul
- pipeline FPmul with MBE multiplier in stage 2 
- pipeline FPmul with additional registers in stage 2
- pipeline FPmul with additional registers in stage 2 and MBE multiplier

The original stage2 is contained inside the common folder.
Testebenches are inside the tb folder, while the sim folder contains ModelSim simulation data.

Scripts for MBE mpy and dadda tree generation are inside the python folder.
Synopsys results and scripts are inside syn folder.
